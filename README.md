# While She Sleeps

**Live Demo:** [my-world.streamlit.app](https://my-world.streamlit.app)

> _A poem written in code._

### 💖 Dedication

I wrote this beside her hospital bed.  
The room was quiet, lit by the hum of monitors and her breathing.  
I couldn’t heal her but I could write what my heart needed to say.  
This isn’t just code, it’s the sound of waiting, loving, and believing in her strength.  
**While She Sleeps** is a love letter built line by line, heartbeat by heartbeat.

### 💡 Concept

A Streamlit app that turns a quiet night of coding into a live, breathing poem.  
Each line appears slowly, like thoughts forming in real time.  
A meditation on love, creation, and the stillness that teaches us what matters most.
I didn't plan it.
